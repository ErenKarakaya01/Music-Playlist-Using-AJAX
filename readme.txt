There are several security problems about AJAX. If you try to open my html page via double click you cannot see the datas in the json files,
because AJAX cannot reach local files without http protocol. One of the ways that you can do to open my html page in the right way is hosting a local server. You can do this with Visual Studio Code. There is an extension in Visual Studio Code named “Live Server”. You can host a local server with that extension easily.
